          <description><![CDATA[<p>As a part of the eOffer, vendors have to submit a technical proposal, covering topics such as corporate experience, past performance, quality control, relevant project experience, and their Service Contract Act (SCA) Matrix.  Vendors would have to compile these outside of eOffer and ultimately upload them to the system.</p><p>GSA took the opportunity to standardize and streamline the process across the MAS program by creating electronic forms within the eOffer system to capture the required information.  This new robust format allows for increased simplicity, while preserving the commodity-specific elements of certain schedules/SINs.</p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>eeOffer has been enhanced to allow on-screen formatted input for the various sections of the technical proposal.  eOffer now has a new section in of eOffer, called Solicitation Provisions,  where offerors can provide written detail about their technical proposal, corporate experience, and other supporting documentation as needed.  The &ldquo;solicitations provisions&rdquo; section will begin to appear to new offerors during the course of 2015.</p><p>Requirements of each section of the provisions are listed with the corresponding text entry boxes.  This ensures consistency and completeness from the vendors.</p><p>The result is a more user-friendly system and standardized eOffer that Contracting Officers can process more efficiently. </p><p>More information on the Solicitation Provisions process can be found in the eOffer Help Center.</p>]]></description>

        <system>eMod</system>
        <type>Update/Enhancement</type>
        <motivation>
          <description><![CDATA[<p>Vendors need the agility to reduce pricing through the Temporary Price Reduction modification, the Permanent Price Reduction Modification (either based on Most Favored Customer or Industry Partner Request).  In the past, vendor’s would need to wait for Contracting Officer approval of the modification before the reduced prices took effect.  The FAS Commissioner’s office wanted to give vendors the power to reduce prices effective as soon as a modification is submitted to do so.  </p>]]></description>
