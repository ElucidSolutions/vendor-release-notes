				<h2 class="bcr-title">Make &ldquo;Re-representation of Business Type&rdquo; Modification Visible At All times</h2><h2 class="system-tag">eMod</h2>
				<div class="update">Update/Enhancement</div>
				<h3 class="bcr-question">Why was this changed?</h3>
				<p>In eMod, you, as a vendor, would only see the <strong><em>Re-representation of Business Type</em></strong> modification when there a change made to your vendor record in <a href="https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/">SAM</a>.  The original functinoary did not allow for all possible scenarios.  As a result, some vendors have had difficulty keeping their contracts-up-to-date.</p>
				<h3 class="bcr-question">How does this affect eMod?</h3>
				<p>eMod will now give you the option to initiate a Re-representation of Business Type modification at all times.  Options will be based upon your businessâ€™s records within SAM.  Vendors will also have the ability to request that a small business type be deleted.</p>
				<p>It is extremely important to note that by to adding/removing business types at the contract level, it could cause a discrepancy in types in other systems. For example, if you, as a vendor, elect to make a change to the contract WITHOUT having made the same change in SAM, it is possible that the contract will display different business types from systems like GSA Advantage, eBuy, and eLibrary. </p>
				<p>Also note that a business type may take 24-48 hours to appear in SAM.</p>
				<p>Read the <strong><em>Re-representation of Business Type</em></strong> modification section in the eOffer/eMod User Guide for more information.<p>

				<div class="update">Update/Enhancement</div>
				<h3 class="bcr-question">Why was this changed?</h3>
				<p>When a you wish to create a new offer based off a withdrawn or rejected offer, the system gives you the ability to import information from the previous eOffer.  This feature did not previously extend to Commercial Sales Practice (CSP) data.</p>

				<p>In re-populating your offer from a previously withdrawn or rejected offer, you will be importing your CSP data with the rest of the information.

				<h2 class="bcr-title">CSP Basis - Discount or Mark up / Build Out</h2><h2 class="system-tag">eOffer/eMod</h2>
				<div class="update">Update/Enhancement</div>
				<h3 class="bcr-question">Why was this changed?</h3>
				<p>Previously, the Commercial Sales Practice (CSP) utility only allowed you, as a vendor, to express  offer or SIN level policies as discounts.  There was no way to capture policies on your CSP in terms of Mark Up/Build Out.</p>
				<h3 class="bcr-question">How does this affect eOffer/eMod?</h3>
				<p>Vendors may now express policies in terms of a mark up or a build out, in addition to a discount, to more accurately express their CSPs.  The vendors will be provided with the following description to help them make their decision:<ul><li><em>Based on a markup over cost (e.g. a 5% markup over the manufacturer's catalog price). This is common for dealer/resellers.  Your company is a dealer/reseller of widgets. The manufacturer catalog price that you pay for the widgets is $10 per widget. The price you are offering GSA is a 5% markup on the price you pay the manufacturer or $10.50.</em></li><li><em>Derived from a buildup of individual cost elements. Your proposed GSA price is derived by totaling the individual cost elements that it takes to produce your product or service, and then adding an amount for profit. Profit, or fee, is usually expressed as a percentage of the cost elements. Your GSA proposed price will typically be a reduced profit or fee applied to the cost elements (e.g. labor + general & administrative + overheard + 5% profit = proposed GSA labor rate).</em></li></ul></p><p>Read the Commercial Sales Practice section in the eOffer/eMod User Guide for more information.</p>
