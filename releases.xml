That section has been updated with new functionality for more detailed responding, which is tailored to your schedule, so that your offer will be managed more intelligently.</p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>The number of MAS contractors coming up on their 20-year maximum contract lifespans will increase rapidly over the next few years.

          <description><![CDATA[<p>As of November 23, 2015, contractors can upload duplicate Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs) to GSA Advantage.

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Contract holders should take this opportunity to review and update their price lists for both accuracy and completeness.  Any altered Manufacturer Part Numbers should be updated so as to be identical to the numbers issued by the manufacturer.</p><p>Per clauses I-FSS-600 Contract Price Lists and 552.238-71 (Submission and Distribution of Authorized FSS Schedule Price Lists), price lists must be complete, and include all supplies, prices, and terms and conditions awarded under a contractor’s FSS contract. A complete price list means that all awarded base products are listed along with all associated descriptive data (to include MPN).</p><p>Going forward you should ensure that correct manufacturer part numbers are submitted for all products in your price list.</p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>As a part of the eOffer, vendors have to submit a technical proposal, covering topics such as corporate experience, past performance, and quality control.  Prior to this update, vendors would have to compile this information in a separate document, and attach it to their offers.</p><p>GSA took the opportunity to standardize and streamline the process across the MAS program by creating electronic forms within the eOffer system.  This new robust format allows for increased simplicity, while preserving the commodity-specific elements of certain schedules/SINs.</p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>During the course of 2015, each solicitation in eOffer will include a new section, titled  &ldquo;solicitations provisions&rdquo;.  In this section, offerors will address provisions specific to each solicitation, and provide written detail about their corporate experience, past performance, and quality control.</p><p>Requirements of each section of the provisions are listed with the corresponding text entry boxes. This ensures consistency and completeness from the vendors. You must respond to all provisions listed in the table, before you may submit your offer.</p><p>The result is a more user-friendly system and standardized eOffer that Contracting Officers can process more efficiently. </p><p>More information on the Solicitation Provisions process can be found in the <em>eOffer Help Center</em>.</p>]]></description>

        <motivation>
          <description><![CDATA[<p>In the past, vendors submitting temporary or permanent price reduction modifications would need to wait for the Contracting Officer to approve the  modification before the modification took effect. In order to better suit the needs of industry, the process needed to be streamlined.  Therefore, it was decided that price reduction modifications would be effective immediately upon submission.</p>]]></description>
