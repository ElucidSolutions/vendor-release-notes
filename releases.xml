          <description><![CDATA[<p>As a part of the eOffer, vendors have to submit a technical proposal, covering topics such as corporate experience, past performance, and quality control.  Prior to this update, vendors would have to compile this information in a separate document, and attach it to their offers.</p><p>GSA took the opportunity to standardize and streamline the process across the MAS program by creating electronic forms within the eOffer system.  This new robust format allows for increased simplicity, while preserving the commodity-specific elements of certain schedules/SINs.</p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>During the course of 2015, each solicitation in eOffer will include a new section, titled  &ldquo;solicitations provisions&rdquo;.  In this section, offerors will address provisions specific to each solicitation, and provide written detail about their corporate experience, past performance, and quality control.</p><p>Requirements of each section of the provisions are listed with the corresponding text entry boxes.  This ensures consistency and completeness from the vendors.  You must respond to all provisions listed in the table, before you may submit your offer.</p><p>The result is a more user-friendly system and standardized eOffer that Contracting Officers can process more efficiently. </p><p>More information on the Solicitation Provisions process can be found in the <em>eOffer Help Center</em>.</p>]]></description>

        <title>Price Reduction Modifications Now Take Effect Upon Submission</title>
        <number>1</number>
        <system>eMod</system>
        <type>Update/Enhancement</type>
        <motivation>
          <description><![CDATA[<p>In the past, vendors submitting temporary or permanent price reduction modifications would need to wait for the Contracting Officer to approve the  modification before the modification took effect.  In order to better suit the needs of industry, the process needed to be streamlined.  Therefore, it was decided that price reduction modifications would be effective immediately upon submission.</p>]]></description>
