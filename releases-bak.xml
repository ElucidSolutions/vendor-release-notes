You may add any business type to your MAS contract that is associated with your DUNS number in SAM. You may, however,remove any business type from your MAS contract. Changes to your MAS contract will not update SAM.</p><p>It is extremely important to note that by to adding/removing business types at the contract level, it could cause a discrepancy in types in other systems. For example, if you, as a vendor, elect to make a change to the contract WITHOUT having made the same change in SAM, it is possible that the contract will display different business types from systems like GSA Advantage, eBuy, and eLibrary.</p><p>Also note that a business type may take 24-48 hours to appear in SAM.</p><p>Read the Re-representation of Business Type modification section in the eOffer/eMod User Guide for more information.</p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Previously, the Commercial Sales Practice (CSP) utility only allowed you, as a vendor, to express offer or SIN level policies as discounts. There was no way to capture policies on your CSP in terms of Mark Up/Build Out.</p>]]></description>

          <description><![CDATA[<p>Vendors may now express policies in terms of a mark up or a build out, in addition to a discount, to more accurately express their CSPs. The vendors will be provided with the following description to help them make their decision:<ul><li>Based on a markup over cost (e.g. a 5% markup over the manufacturer's catalog price). This is common for dealer/resellers. Your company is a dealer/reseller of widgets. The manufacturer catalog price that you pay for the widgets is $10 per widget. The price you are offering GSA is a 5% markup on the price you pay the manufacturer or $10.50.</li><li>Derived from a buildup of individual cost elements. Your proposed GSA price is derived by totaling the individual cost elements that it takes to produce your product or service, and then adding an amount for profit. Profit, or fee, is usually expressed as a percentage of the cost elements. Your GSA proposed price will typically be a reduced profit or fee applied to the cost elements (e.g. labor + general & administrative + overheard + 5% profit = proposed GSA labor rate).</li></ul>Read the Commercial Sales Practice section in the eOffer/eMod User Guide for more information.</p>]]></description>
